# Positioning

The CSS positioning properties allow you to position an element. It can also
place an element behind another, and specify what should happen when an
element's content is too big.

## Static

HTML elements are positioned static by default. A static positioned element is
always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.

Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right
properties.

## Fixed
An element with fixed position is positioned relative to the browser window.
It will not move even if the window is scrolled.

## Relative
A relative positioned element is positioned relative to its normal position.

## Absolute
An absolute position element is positioned relative to the first parent element
that has a position other than static.
